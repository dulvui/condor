!!WARNING!!  
There is now an official Windows, MacOS and Web app for by fantacalcio.it for real time live auction https://www.fantacalcio.it/app-fantaasta  
For official support and a overall better experience, I recommend using the official one.
If you care about being Open Source or running it on Linux and mobile (not released yet), Condor is stil a valid option.


Desktop and web (mobile not yet) application for the Fantacalcio auction.

Made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) version 4.2.0
